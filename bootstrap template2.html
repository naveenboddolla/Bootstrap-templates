            It was a Friday in mid-August 2011, and Brian Moynihan and his top two lieutenants were sharing a late dinner at Press, a wine-and-sushi bar a couple of blocks from Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte. Moynihan, who had been at the helm of the 94-year-old institution for just 20 months, had cut a Florida vacation short to try to address the crisis, which seemed to be mounting by the day. Some analysts predicted the mortgage mess inherited from BofA’s newly acquired Merrill Lynch and Countrywide subsidiaries was bad enough to sink the whole enterprise. BofA had just gotten sued for $10 billion by AIG for losses it claimed on “fraudulent” mortgages packaged by Countrywide, Merrill, and BofA. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had just announced that because the economy looked far weaker than he’d predicted months before, the Fed intended hold interest rates low for an extended period. BofA shares had fallen to $7, half their value from the start of 2011.
